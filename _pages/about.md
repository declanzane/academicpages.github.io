I currently lead the Computer Vision Research team at Tencent Map, with a long-standing dedication to the field of autonomous driving (4 years in Baidu with experience in end-to-end autonomous driving and HDMAP perception research). My research interests span across artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning, with a particular focus on 3D perception and reconstruction within autonomous driving. My research achievements have been published in multiple top-tier conferences, including AAAI, ICCV, ECCV, and WACV, with one of my co-authored papers earning the IAAI Application Innovation Award. I also organized the 1st Workshop on Large Language and Vision Models for Autonomous Driving (LLVM-AD) in the WACV 2024.
