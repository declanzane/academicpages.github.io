I currently lead the Computer Vision Research team at Tencent Map, with a long-standing dedication to the field of autonomous driving(4 years in Baidu with experience in end to end autonomous driving and HDMAP preception research). My research interests span across artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning, with a particular focus on 3D perception and reconstruction within autonomous driving. My research achievements have been published in multiple top-tier conferences, including AAAI, ICCV, ECCV, and WACV, with one of his co-authored papers earning the IAAI Application Innovation Award.
